# Who am I ?
I initially pursued a degree in social sciences while gaining practical experience through internships in various cultural organizations, (FIFDH Palp Festival, and the Red Cross Museum). These roles allowed me to develop skills in project management and cultural programming.

While completing my master's degree, I was hired as a Music Programming Assistant and Production Manager, which gave me the opportunity to further my expertise in managing live events and coordinating festivals. Later, I took on the role of Head of Production at Visions du Réel, where I was responsible for managing the festival's logistics, including ticketing, infrastructure, hospitality, IT systems, and working closely with external partners.

During my time at Visions du Réel, I discovered coding while leading the festival’s transition to an online platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sparked my interest in IT, and I began learning to code in my free time. This passion led me to apply to École 42 in Lausanne, where I was accepted and have since fully committed to expanding my technical skills.

I’m excited to explore opportunities that blend my background in cultural management with my growing expertise in software development.

# What is 42 ?
Ecole 42 is a unique, tuition-free coding school that focuses on peer-to-peer learning and project-based education. There are no formal classes or teachers; instead, students develop programming skills through real-world projects, collaboration, and self-guided learning. My GitHub repository contains the projects I’ve completed during my time at Ecole 42, showcasing my work in various areas such as algorithms, system programming, and software development.

I started 42 in October 2023 in Lausanne.
